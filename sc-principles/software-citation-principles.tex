\section{Introduction \& motivation}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As the process of science has become increasingly digital, scientific outputs and products have
grown beyond simple papers and books to include software, data, and other electronic
components.  Scientific knowledge is embedded in these components.  And papers and books
themselves are also becoming increasingly digital, allowing them to executable
and reproducible.  As we move towards this future where science is performed in and recorded
as a variety of linked digital products, the characteristics and properties that developed for
books and papers need to be applied to all digital products.  Here, we are concerned specifically
with the citation of software products.

The Force11 Software Citation Working Group~\cite{f11scwg} has been studying this,
beginning in ...  with a number of meetings ... and has prepared this document for
presentation at Force2016~\cite{force2016} and further discussion.  We expect that
this discussion may lead to a second, final version of this document, and we also
plan to have a follow-on working group that will work with stakeholders to ensure that
these principles impact the scientific process.

In the next section (\S\ref{sec:use_cases}), we provide some detailed context in which
software citation is important, by means of use cases.  In \S\ref{sec:related_work}, we
summarize and analyze a large amount of previous work and thinking in this area.  In
\S\ref{sec:principles}, we provide set of guiding principles for citation of software within
scholarly literature, other software dataset, or any other research object.  Finally,
in \S\ref{sec:examples} we give examples of how these software citation principles
could be applied, related back to the use cases in \S\ref{sec:use_cases}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Use cases}
\label{sec:use_cases}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have documented and analyzed a set of use cases related to software citation in \cite{SC-Use-Cases}.
Table~\ref{tab:use_cases} summarizes these use cases and makes clear what the requirements are for software citation in each case.
\katznote{not sure if this next long sentence should be here, should be in the table caption, or should be footnotes to the table, or even more than one of these}
\niemnote{Not sure either; definitely should include in the text due to length. Maybe an abbreviated version in the caption?}
In the table,
``researcher'' includes both academic researchers (e.g., postdoc, tenure-track faculty member) and research software engineers;
``publisher'' includes both traditional publishers that publish text and\slash or software papers as well as archives such as Zenodo that directly publish software;
``reproduce'' can mean reproduction, replication, verification, validation, repeatability, and\slash or utility;
examples of indexers include Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Microsoft Academic Search;
domain groups include bioCADDIE, CIG, etc.;
``repository'' refers to open-source software repositories such as ASCL, GitHub, Netlib, CRAN, institutional repositories;
``funder'' is a group that funds software or work using software; and
``UID'' means unique ID, such as DOI or PURL.

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related_work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

With close to 50 working group partipants representing a range of research domains, the working group was tasked to
document existing practices in their respective communities. A total of 47 documents were submitted by working group
participants with the life sciences, astrophysics and geosciences being particularly well-represented in the submitted
resources.

\textbf{Breakdown of resources}

NOTE: Should mention that a number of communities have already focussed their attention on issues around data citation and while
this isn't exactly the same there are many similarities (what is different exactly?).

\textbf{General community/non domain-specific efforts}

Some of the most actionable work has come from the SSI in the form of blog posts written by their community fellows:

In a blog post from 2012, \cite{ssi-how-to-cite} discussing some of the pitfalls of trying to cite software in publications.
The author includes useful guidance for when to consider citing software as well as some ways to help `convince' journal editors
to allow the inclusion of software citations.

In \cite{ssi-citation-files}, Wilson suggests that software authors include a `CITATION' file that documents exactly how the
authors of the software would like to be cited by others. While this isn't a formal metadata specification (it's not machine
readable for example) this does offer a solution for authors wishing to give explicit instructions to potential citing authors.
In a later post on the SSI blog, Jackson \cite{ssi-how-shalt-i-cite-thee} gives a good overview of some of the approaches
package authors have taken to automate the generation of citation entities such as bibtex entries.

NSF/NIH workshops. WSSSPE. JISC reports.

\textbf{Domain-specific community activities}

Astronomy: ASCL, AAS journals announcing they will accept software papers in their journals \cite{aas-sofware-papers}. AAS/GitHub
workshop \cite{aas-software-index} dedicated to software citation, indexing and discoverability.

....lots more to add here.

\textbf{Existing principles}

Author guidelines in F1000Research, APA authors, SSI `publish or be damned' \cite{ssi-publish-or-be-damned} manifesto.

\textbf{Existing efforts around metadata standards}

AAS workshop (\cite{aas-software-index}), CRediT project \cite{casrai-credit}, others...

\textbf{Studies of author motivations}

Survey of data citation practices \cite{Kratz_2015}

\section{Software citation principles}
\label{sec:principles}

\katznote{The current content of this section is liberally borrowed and loosely adapted from \cite{data-citation-principles}.  We we will want to add some text here explaining that we started with that document, and then modified it to take into account the information from the use cases and the related work, once we do so.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Importance}:
Software should be considered a legitimate, citable product of research. Software citations should be accorded the same importance in the scholarly record as citations of other research objects, such as publications and data.
\item \textbf{Credit and Attribution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Software citations should facilitate giving scholarly credit and normative and legal attribution to all contributors to the software, recognizing that a single style or mechanism of attribution may not be applicable to all software.
\item In scholarly literature and other products, whenever and wherever a claim relies upon software, the corresponding software should be cited.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Unique Identification}
A software citation should include a persistent method for identification that is machine actionable, globally unique, and widely used by a community.
\item \textbf{Access}
Software citations should facilitate access to the software themselves and to such associated metadata, documentation, data, and other materials, as are necessary for both humans and machines to make informed use of the referenced software.
\item \textbf{Persistence}
Unique identifiers, and metadata describing the software, and its disposition, should persist -- even beyond the lifespan of the software they describe.
\item \textbf{Specificity and Verifiability}
Software citations should facilitate identification of, access to, and verification of the specific software that support a claim. Citations or citation metadata should include information about provenance and fixity sufficient to facilitate verifying that the specific version and/or portion of software retrieved subsequently is the same as was originally cited.
\item \textbf{Interoperability and Flexibility}
Software citation methods should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the variant practices among communities, but should not differ so much that they compromise interoperability of software citation practices across communities.
\end{enumerate}
